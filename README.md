# README

Hi! It seems that you have found this project. 

The project is for **ISTBI** nndl homework in fall 2021. So you may not need it. 

I'm very honored that you refer to this project but I should say that you can only refer to and not plagiarize. **PLEASE NO COPY.**

Since this is only my solution to homework so it may not be perfect, if you found something poor or even wrong(incluing README because of my poor English), you could tell me and I would make it better if I have time.

Have a happy term.
